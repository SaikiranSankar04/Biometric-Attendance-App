Traditional attendance systems suffer from critical drawbacks:
1. High latency due to cloud-only processing
2. Manual proxy risks (RFID, ID cards)
3. No real-time monitoring or access integration

To overcome these issues, we present a system with:
1. Biometric authentication and Servo lock for secure entry
2. No internet dependency for local operations
3. Cloud sync for backup and global access
4. React dashboard for real-time attendance visualization
5. Timestamped logs with present/absent status and daily summary, can be downloaded in an excel sheet
